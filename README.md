<h1>LISA FAIREFILED - ACTRESS</h1>

<p>The aim of this website is to promote and attract potential casting agents that are looking for 
roles in Adverts, Theatre and Film. Providing Lisa Fairfield the opportunity to catapult her career 
in the dexterous world of acting.</p>


<h1>UX</h1>

<p>Our client desires a website to seek out an agent while being able to use the website on business 
cards and on email signatures. Once an agent is established the ultimate prize would then to be 
introduced to a producer.</p>

<h3>STRATEGY</h3>

<p>The main focus of the website is to allure and attract potential casting agents and writers to seek 
roles for Lisa Fairfield in a broad range of roles, including adverts, theatre and films. With the 
acting market being heavily competitive, the website needs to stand out from the crowd; be intuitive 
in consuming information; while exuding professionalism. It needs to work well on mobile devices while 
users are on the move, as well as working on tablets and desktop to allow for a more comfortable viewing 
in the office/ home.</p>

_<center>”Producers and directors work under a lot of pressure. Searching for actors/ actresses will be a 
ruthless process”</center>_

_<center>“Casting agents mainly seek information on: Naturalness, Personality, Professionalism, 
Well-rounded, Training”</center>_

_<center>“To have an online presence so that casting directors, producers and directors who are 
interested can learn more about you.”</center>_

<h3>SCOPE</h3>

<p>An online presence is fundamental and will be implemented. The client has provided a montage of 
photos that will be narrowed down to highlight her different personalities. A biography of reviews 
and past and present performances, along with a ‘blurb’, will be provided by my client. With 
Lisa Fairfield being at the start of her career, show reels/ voice reels are not adequate and hence 
feasible at this stage to implement. This should however change as time passes. A blog could also be a nice 
little feature to add yet once again this can be discussed at a later date. The tradeoff in not implementing 
all desired features at this stage should not jeopardize the initiation of a website as the content we can 
add will be enough to kick-start Lisa Fairfield’s career.</p>

<h3>STRUCTURE</h3>

The website needs to be clean and slick without too much clutter and information to prevent cognitive 
overload. It needs to be fresh, stylistic and minimalist for the artistic audience.  At the same time 
it needs to provide enough content to promote Lisa Fairfield as an actress. A ‘hero-image’ will be the 
prominent feature on the index.html page, alluring potential agents and enticing them to learn more. 
The navigation bar and footer will remain fixed, being consistent in all subsequent pages. Slight 
alterations will be made on the navigation bars in mobile and tablets to maintain the look and feel. 
The navigation bar will include tabs for Home, Gallery, Bio, Resume and Contact. My client’s name will 
be centered above the navigation bar in clear standout font. The footer will include a clickable email 
and telephone number and be viewable in all pages so that an agent can click intuitively and with ease 
without.</p>
