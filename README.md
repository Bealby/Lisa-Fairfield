<h1>UX</h1>

<p>Our client desires a website to seek out an agent, while being able to use the website on business 
cards and on email signatures. Once an agent is established the ultimate goal would be for it to 
lead to a producer.</p>

<br>

<h3>STRATEGY</h3>

<p>The main focus of the website is to allure and attract potential casting agents and writers 
to seek Lisa Fairfield in a broad range of roles, including adverts, theatre and films. With 
the acting market being heavily competitive, the website needs to stand out from the crowd; be 
intuitive in gaining information; while exuding professionalism.</p>

<p>It needs to work well on mobile devices while users are on the move, as well as working on 
tablets and desktop to allow for a more comfortable viewing in the office/ home.</p>

<br>

- *”Producers and directors work under a lot of pressure. Searching for actors/ actresses will be a 
ruthless process”*

- *“Casting agents mainly seek information on: Naturalness, Personality, Professionalism, 
Well-rounded, Training”*

- *“To have an online presence so that casting directors, producers and directors who are 
interested can learn more about you.”*

<h3>SCOPE</h3>

<p>An online presence is fundamental and will be implemented. The client has provided a montage of
photos that will be narrowed down to highlight her different personalities. A biography of reviews
and past and present performances, along with a ‘blurb’, will be provided by my client. With Lisa 
Fairfield being at the start of her career, show reels/ voice reels are not adequate and hence feasible 
at this stage to implement. This should however change as time passes. A blog could also be a nice little feature 
to add once my client’s career has taken-off.</p>

<p>The tradeoff in not implementing all desired features mentioned, will not be at the detriment of the 
website, as the content we can add will be suffice to kick-start Lisa Fairfield’s career.</p>

<br>

<h3>STRUCTURE</h3>

<p>The website needs to be clean and slick without too much clutter and information, which can cause 
cognitive overload. It needs to be fresh, stylistic and minimalist for the artistic audience.  At 
the same time it needs to provide enough content to promote Lisa Fairfield as an actress. A ‘hero-image’ 
will be the prominent feature on the index.html page, alluring potential agents and enticing them to 
learn more. The navigation bar and footer will remain fixed through all pages. Alterations will be made 
on the navigation bars in mobile and tablets to maintain the look and feel.</p>

<p>The navigation bar will include tabs for Home, Gallery, Bio, Resume and Contact. My client’s name
will be centered above the navigation bar in clear standout font. The footer will include a clickable 
email and telephone number and be viewable in all pages so that an agent can click intuitively and with 
ease.</p>

<br>

<h3>SURFACE</h3>

<p>It is important not to overly <i>glitz-and-glam</i> the website (as the user may believe), but to keep the 
website slick and minimal so that is easy for a potential agent to navigate. I have chosen to use a white 
color theme with grey dividers for overall structure. This will allow photos and text to stand out boldly 
against the white background, encouraging the desire and ease to navigate fluidly.</p>
